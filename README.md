# Basic Static Web Site

This is a very straight forward example of a responsive HTML5 web site, using validated html/css, and meeting the Level AA rating for Web Content Accessibility Guildelines (WCAG 2.0).

In addition it also supports Internet Explorer 8+, including media queries for responsiveness.

It's not going to win any awards for design :-)
